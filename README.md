# BEV Attack

## About

3D visual perception tasks, including 3D detection and map segmentation are essential for autonomous driving systems. One promising method is BEV perception, which perform detection or segmentaion from bird's eye view. Large numbers of works have demonstrated the vulnerability of 3D detection models either using LiDAR or camera images. However, the robustness of BEV model is less exploited. In this work, we try to study the robustness of BEV model under different adversarial attacks or common corruptions.
